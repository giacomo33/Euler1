# Euler problem 1
An algorithm to sum all the natural numbers that are multiples of 3 or 5. e.g For the number 9 this would result is a sum of 23. The sum of the numbers under 1000 would be 233168. While this is a seemingly simple problem, the solution focues on using the IEnumerable namespace to find an innovative solution.
